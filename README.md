# DeLormeGridOverlay

Userscripts for overlaying DeLorme Page boundary grids on top of the geocaching.com search page.
- multiState.user.js handles all US states that have active Delorme challenges.
- CaliforniaGrids.user.js is a special version for those working on Northern and/or Southern California with Golden State in mind too. It offers easy switching between the 3 Delorme grids so you can see which qualify for which challenge.

Opening either file in raw mode and Tampermonkey installed will result in Tampermonkey prompting you to install or update the script. Note: running both multiState and CaliforniaGrids at the same time is a bad idea. Disable one or the other via the Tampermonnkey dashboard. If all you care about is Northern or Southern or Golden State, those can be used via the multiState script.
